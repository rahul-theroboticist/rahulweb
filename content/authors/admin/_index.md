I am a robotics researcher and freelance robotics educator. I enjoy conducting user case studies and finding better solutions for existing problems in the robotics field, but I'm most passionate about building end-to-end systems that integrates learning algorithms, perception, planning, and control for real-world applications. 

I am an aspiring full-stack roboticist. Since my undergraduate studies, I have been exploring the world of robotics. With a B.Tech in mechatronics engineering and MSc by research (MRes) in robotics, I had worked in different areas of robotics research namely aerial robotics, unmanned surface vehicles, continuum robotics and more recently in human-robot interaction. My current research interests include nonlinear dynamics, motion planning, and control of robot manipulators and underactuated systems with an emphasis on different learning methods.      

During my free time, I like reading murder-mystery novels, playing chess and bike riding.
